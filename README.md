  Use the ‚ÄúPinned‚Äù section on your profile to showcase up to 6 top repositories that highlight your skills and interests.

- **Write Detailed READMEs:**  
  Each project should have a clear README explaining its purpose, setup instructions, usage, and what you learned.

  Descriptive commit messages (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd login feature‚Äù) show professionalism and make your work easier to understand.

  Share small projects, coding exercises, or solutions to challenges (like from LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars).

- **Contribute to Open Source:**  
  Look for ‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù or ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù labels on repositories. Even fixing typos or documentation helps!

- **Add a GitHub Actions Badge:**  
  Set up GitHub Actions for testing/linting and display the status badge in your README.

  Celebrate certificates, completed courses, hackathons, or recognitions in your README.
